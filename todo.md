## Large tasks

- Finish graph: vertexes, edges, directions, strings
- Save+Load state
- Full-screen rendering (top bar with location, score, moves)
- Arrow keys behave like prompt

## Medium tasks

   ```
   You are empty-handed.
   ```

     The glass bottle contains:
       A quantity of water
     A brown sack
   ```
- Add `Revision 88 / Serial number 840726` line, e.g.:
  ```sh
  echo Revision $(git rev-list --all --count) / Serial number $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
  ```

## Small tasks

- `restart` command
- 'number of moves' starts at 1 instead of 0 (because of `zork.rkt`'s `repl/handler` call)

- Verbosity:
  ```
  verbose:    Maximum verbosity.

  ```

                    Are you enjoying yourself?
                    Do you expect me to applaud?
                    Wheeeeeeeeee!!!!!
  scream, shout:    "Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!"
  rape x:           "What an (ahem!) strange idea."
  zork:             "At your service."

  ```
